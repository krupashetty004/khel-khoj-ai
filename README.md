# Khel-Khoj AI

### Project Overview
**Khel-Khoj AI (Game Search)** is an AI-powered platform designed to identify and analyze athletic talent in rural India.  
Coaches can upload videos of athletes, and the system uses computer vision and generative AI to evaluate biomechanics, agility, and performance to generate detailed scouting reports.  
This project integrates **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**, **Firebase**, **YOLO**, and **Gemini AI** to form a full-stack AI sports analysis platform.

#### 2. Version Control (Git & GitHub)
- Create a **new branch for each Phase** (e.g., `phase-0`, `phase-1`).
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages such as:
  - `Feat: Implement video upload component`
  - `Fix: Correct pose estimation logic`
- Push to GitHub **daily** for version tracking and visibility.

#### 3. Screen Recordings
At the completion of every major phase:
- Record a short **2–5 minute video** showing:
  - What was built  
  - Key technical concepts used  
  - Challenges solved and takeaways
